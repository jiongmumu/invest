# ADX indicator

ADX is used to quantify trend strength. ADX calculations are based on a [moving average](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/movingaverage.asp) of price range expansion over a given period of time. The default setting is 14 bars, although other time periods can be used. ADX can be used on any trading vehicle such as stocks, mutual funds, [exchange-traded funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) and futures.

ADX is plotted as a single line with values ranging from a low of zero to a high of 100. ADX is non-directional; it registers trend strength whether price is trending up or down. The indicator is usually plotted in the same window as the two [directional movement indicator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dmi.asp) \(DMI\) lines, from which ADX is derived.
